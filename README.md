Today's topic is user input and type conversion!

**Goal:** Build interactive programs that accept user input and convert between data types

- **task1:** Get user's name and greet them

- **task2:** Ask for two numbers, convert them to int, add them together

- **task3:** Ask for age, convert to int, calculate birth year

- **task4:** Get a number as input, convert to float and int, observe the difference

- **task5:** Try converting text to int (handle the error with try/except)

**mini-project:**
Age Calculator: Ask user for their name and age, calculate how many months, weeks, and days old they are, then display results in formatted sentences
