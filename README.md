Today's topic is **User Input & Type Conversion**!

## 🎯 Goal
Build interactive programs that accept user input and convert between data types.

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- Using `input()` to get user input (⚠️ always returns a **string**)
- Type conversion:
  - `int()`
  - `float()`
  - `str()`
  - `bool()`
- Why type conversion is necessary for calculations
- Combining user input with mathematical operations
- Common errors:
  - `ValueError` when converting invalid strings (e.g. trying `int("hello")`)

---

## 🧠 Coding Exercises

- **task1:** Get the user's name and greet them  
- **task2:** Ask for two numbers, convert them to `int`, and add them together  
- **task3:** Ask for the user's age, convert it to `int`, and calculate their birth year  
- **task4:** Get a number as input, convert it to both `float` and `int`, and observe the difference  
- **task5:** Try converting text to `int` and handle the error using `try` and `except`

## 🚀 Mini Project

### Age Calculator

Create an interactive program that:

1. Asks the user for their **name**
2. Asks for their **age**
3. Converts the age to an integer
4. Calculates how many:
   - Months old they are
   - Weeks old they are
   - Days old they are
5. Displays the results in formatted sentences
